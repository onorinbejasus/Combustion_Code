Bugs: I fixed the hole at the top of the sphere

Notes: Everything seems to be working properly. Here are the commands:

b: turn on normals
' ': third/first person point of view
s,w: move forward and back
h,j: move side to side
a,d: rotate camera

do not use these commands unless looking at an object located at 0,0,0. I only put these in to work on individual shapes. These keys rotate the shape around the respected axis

X,x
Y,y
Z,y 

Shape List:

0 - House
1 - Cube
2 - Sphere
3 - Cone
4 - Torus
5 - Cylinder
